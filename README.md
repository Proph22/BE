Our Project is called "Always American" Our goal is to improve on the AA flyer's experience and make it as seamless and personalized as possible, utilizing Mastercard's QR & SRC API.
We plan to implement our idea in three points: Before, During, and After the flight.
Before:
We want to use MasterCards QR API to allow for a swift grab n go of amenities and the click to pay API to allow pre-choosing of food options with ease, making the boarding process even more seamless.
During:
We want to personalize the AA Flyers Experience by allowing to have the flyer set preferences on ammenities they frequently enjoy, such as snacks, beverages, and adult drinks. While personalizing this experience, we hope to increase the fluidity as well by implementing the QR api so a customer can easily scan and receive their purchase or click to pay for purchases they frequently make.
After:
Even after the flight lands, we want American to be on our flyer's mind. So utilizing Push Notifications 30 minutes before the flight lands and 30 minutes after. We'll ask the flyer if they have arranged hotels and transportation and if not link them to Uber/Lyft or an airport associate to make sure they're traveling securely.
